This folder contains code to do some simple analysis on the processed/cleaned data.

The exploratory_analysis.qmd file pulls and runs code chunks from the exploratoryanalysis.r script. The html file is the output of rendering the qmd file. The exploratory_analysis_files folder holds the images and figures generated by the code. Summary tables can be found in the results folder.


An R script does some simple statistical model fitting. To be added later.
