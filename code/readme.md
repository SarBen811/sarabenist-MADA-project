This folder contains code to load, clean, process, and analyze my data.

The `processing_code` folder contains R script and Quarto files to load and clean the data. Render the `processingfile.qmd` Quarto file in this folder first. This pulls coding script from the `processingcode.r` script. 

The `analysis_code` folder contains R script and Quarto files to load and clean the data. Render the `exploratory_analysis.qmd` Quarto file after running `processingfile.qmd`.

The `statistical_analysis.r` is not operational with current dataset. Do not run the code.
