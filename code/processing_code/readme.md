This folder contains code for processing data.

The processingfile.qmd pulls and runs code chunks located in the processingcode.r file. 

Rendering the qmd file produces an html file which can be found under processingfile.html.

The processingfile_files folder holds any images and figures produced by the processingfile.qmd.
